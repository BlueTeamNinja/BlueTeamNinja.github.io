# Juice your Shell!

The *nix crew has had the fun for WAY too long.  I use Yakuake or Guake for a single reason:  Quake-style slider.  Not only because its unbelievably handy - but it reminds me of my youth where I could smash any internet stranger in a Rail Arena or Rocket in Quake 2.  Oh... youth is wasted on the young. 

Anyways, here is my wish list: 

* Quake-style drop-down
* Transparent **
* Easily connect to some of my admin shells (*PowerCLI*, *Exchange Management Shell*, *Skype for Business*, and *SCCM*)
* A useful launch / MOTD
* A picture of a Ninja somewhere
* Colourful *
* Easily switch between 
**elevated** and daily driver console

> *Colour is spelled with a 'u' - Fight me. 

> **So I can the `sfc /scannow` advice from technet while I'm in the shell

## IT CAN BE DONE!

Meet the stars of performance: 
1. ConEmu
2. MOTD Powershell
3. Some Profile-Fu
4. The Remote Shells
5. The hundreds of hours I wasted PoSh'ing out some ASCII art.
