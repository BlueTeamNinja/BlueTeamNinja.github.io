# You've been using a Phone and Browser wrong this WHOLE TIME

Here is how you spend the whole day with your phone on the charger and not lose the plot. 

## Step 1:  Chrome Remote Desktop

Not the greatest remote solution in the world but you can use it from anywhere super easily and the security is respectable.  I don't care what Google does with your data or my data - as long as those intended to make money off of it, and myself are the only ones accessing it. 

## Step 1A:  Bluestacks

Leave your favourite games running in a full instance of Bluestacks on the Beast Gaming/CAD/Server you have in your basement. 

## Step 2:  SMS in the browser

Get the official Google (seriously, I have nothing to do with them) Messages app.  
[Then Rock it](https://messages.android.com)

## Step 2A:  More IM in the browser

Ditto for: 
 * [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org)
 * [WhatsApp](https://web.whatsapp.com)
 * [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me) (If you are an inner child)
 * and even [IRC!](https://webchat.freenode.net/)

## Step 3:  Grip and Rip your PodCasts!  Whoa.

I use [Pocket Casts](https://play.pocketcasts.com) and love pausing in the car and resuming in the browser.  I'm sure there are other things that do the thing that I want my things to do, but that's not my thing.... or something.

===

 Now you have Games & Apps, and IM. 
 This is also my sole purpose of the browser bar.  Add your selection of the above to the browser bar so you can start your day with a <kbd>Right Click</kbd> + `Open All (5)` and begin your day right.  The phone is at 100% by coffee time. 


## Step 4:  Profit. 

 Thanks for tuning in.  Insert your favourite memes here and do not fold or bend this document.
