# Juice your Shell!

###### Be the hero the world needs
![](2019-11-17-14-05-46.png)

The *nix crew has had the fun for WAY too long.  I use Yakuake (Non-gnome) or Guake (Gnome) for a single reason:  Quake-style slider.  Not only because its unbelievably handy - but it fondly reminds me of my youth where I could smash any internet stranger in a Rail Arena or Rocket in Quake 2.  Oh... youth is wasted on the young. 

### The wish list: 

* Quake-style drop-down
* Transparent **
* **Easily** connect to some of my admin shells (*PowerCLI*, *Exchange Management Shell*, *Skype for Business*, and *SCCM*)
* A useful launch / MOTD
* A picture of a Ninja somewhere
* Colourful *
* **Easily** switch between 
**elevated** and daily driver console - because neither **you** nor I are silly enough to use our workstation as admin.  Don't be daft. 

#### Notes
> *Colour is spelled with a 'u' - Fight me.
> 
> **So I can the `sfc /scannow` advice from technet while I'm in the shell.  Transparent shells make following guides / docs easy.  Just learn to love it.

## IT CAN BE DONE!

### Windows Edition

Meet the stars of performance 
1. [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
2. PowerShell [Get-MOTD](https://github.com/mmillar-bolis/ps-motd)
3. Some Profile-Fu
4. The Remote Shells
5. The hundreds of hours I wasted PoSh'ing out some ASCII art.

### MacOS Edition

1. Using iTerm2 instead of Conemu
2. Tweaking the app file to stop being a jerk and just act like the console it is
3. It's an actual *nix Shell and I don't have Office 365 - so I'm driving blind as far as getting a Mac -> Exchange Shell with a hotkey
